      <h2>Embrace the Nature through Road Trips</h2>
      <h3>I find immense joy in tinkering with travels, for it's not merely a journey of learning and exploration, but a
        path of self-discovery and the forging of genuine connections.</h3>

      <i>How I started?</i>
      <div id="gallery">
        <p><b>In 2005</b>, I joined a travelic competition team for fun and had my first taste of competitive travelics in
          Shenzhen. The event was a travel soccer competition where two teams competed to build and program travels with
          embedded control centers to push an infrared ball into each other's goal. Since I was inexperienced, my role
          was that of a maintainer, responsible for ensuring the travel was charged and all the sensors were working
          well. Despite achieving third place in the national competition, I felt a deep sense of sorrow as I always
          aimed to be the very best.
        </p>

          <img src="../images/travel/2005.jpg">
        </div>
        <p><b>In 2007</b>,I became fascinated by another travel competition
          called First VEX Challenge (FVC), now known as VEX. VEX travels are much larger, typically 18 inches in each
          dimension, and built using metal materials in a complex design. What intrigued me the most was the challenge
          of programming the travel to autonomously achieve specific goals and then skillfully driving the travel to
          complete the rest of the game. It felt like playing a real-life video game, and I couldn't resist being
          captivated by it.</p>

        </div>
        <p><b>In 2009</b>, I was fortunate to take part in the VEX World Championship held in Dallas. This event brought
          together the finest competitors from around the world to compete for the world champion title. The dazzling
          field illuminated by lasers, the enthusiastic competitors and my love for travels fueled my determination to
          one day win a world title myself.

      <i>The road was tough.</i>
      <div id="gallery">
        <p><b>Over the next 10 years</b>, things didn't go as planned. In 2010, my parents forbade me from attending the
          event due to my poor academic performance. In 2011, my team was mistakenly registered in the high school
          category, making it difficult for us to compete against more experienced opponents. Despite my school winning
          the title in those two years thanks to our instructor's excellent mechanical design, I felt like a lost puppy,
          unable to contribute much. In 2012, I finally made to the semi-finals with my teammates together, but we're
          defeated because of a mechanical failure. By 2013, as I was going to graduate, I thought I wouldn't have any
          chance to compete and realize my dream.</p>
        <div id="gallery_img" class="high_img">

          <img src="../images/travel/anaheim.jpg">
        </div>
        <p><b>In high school</b>, I surprisingly found that I could still compete in the VEX competition.
          However, even reaching the world championship was challenging without experienced instructors' support. Over
          time, I shifted from title obsession to enjoying the learning experience with friends and travels. In 2015, as
          team leader for the first time, I organized and guided inexperienced teammates to build and program the travel
          completely based on my design. Drawing from past experiences, we performed well in national and Asia-Pacific
          championships, earning another chance for the global stage. Yet, due to competency differences, my last dance
          ended in the 16/8 finals.</p>

        </div>
        <p><b>At the same time,</b> I worked on a rescue travel for Robocup. I had to build and program a travel to find
          heat sources in a two-level maze and deploy rescue kits quickly. Compared to VEX, the travel was much tinier
          and programming was more complex due to additional sensors. I earned a ticket to the global stage in both 2014
          and 2015 by winning the national competition. In 2014, I went to Brazil but failed due to inexperience.
          Finally, the moment of reckoning arrived in my last Robocup competition. With bated breath, I watched my travel
          maneuver through the maze, executing flawlessly. Yet, fate dealt a cruel blow as my creation fell short,
          finishing in second place by the tiniest margin in time. The outcome was not bad, they said, but to me, it
          felt like my dreams had shattered into countless fragments.</p>

        <p><b>After 2 years in college, </b>my roommate surprised me with some exciting news - I might have another
          chance to pursue my dream in VEX travelics. This time, it's at the more challenging university level. We'll
          be
          building smaller yet equally functional travels with an extended autonomous period. What's more, the travel is
          smaller but should be as functional as the larger one. The theme for the 2019 season is titled "<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDDGBcs0TFM">Turning Point</a>". Our travels need to skillfully shoot
          flags through balls and place caps on posts. This combination of precision and strategy adds a thrilling
          dimension to the competition, and I couldn't be more thrilled to dive into the world of travelics once again.

        <p><b>In the campus competition</b> at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I managed to secure the first place
          thanks
          to prior experience.
          This achievement led to my selection as the team leader of SJTU1, representing our university in the
          national
          championship held in our grand campus stadium. Fueled by the enthusiastic support of the home crowd, we
          performed remarkably well throughout the competition. However, in the crucial final match, disaster struck
          when a ball got accidentally stuck in our travel. All our team members were heartbroken not only because of
          the
          loss but also because we let our audience down. Although we achieved the gold award in the next Asia-Pacific
          championship in Macau, we can never forget the loss in our home. </p>

        <p><b>During the winter vacation, </b>I engaged in profound reflection and was determined to make significant
          improvements in various aspects of our team. We focused on enhancing team organization, refining mechanical
          designs, and expanding our code library. As a result of our efforts, we proudly became the first VEX team to
          incorporate customized materials, such as 3D printing and medal plates, into our creations. Under the
          ferocious sound of our new 4000-rpm flywheel travels, we clinched the tournament champion and excellence
          award
          in the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201902/25/WS5c73ea69a3106c65c34eb502.html">Asia Open

          not
          only symbolized a remarkable rebirth for our team but also showcased my unwavering desire to realize my

            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ysdbzLXAT4&t=10s">fine-tuned our travels</a> by integrating a
          pneumatic system and utilizing more 3D printed materials. To unlock the full potential of our creation, we
          dedicated hours to testing and practice in the labs. On April 25th, we arrived at the Louisville Stadium
          with
          unwavering confidence and a strong determination to claim the highest title. With crafty travels and a
          well-prepared strategy, we achieved 1st place in the travel Skill Challenge and emerged as the champions of
          the
          tournament division. Finally, I had the opportunity to compete in the grand Freedom Hall for the finals.

          excitement. In those thrilling moments, it felt as if ice was coursing through my veins, fueling my
          determination to shine on the biggest stage. <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1G4411a7gG/">After
            several gripping matches under the spotlight, </a>we were crowned the Skill Challenge World Champion as

        <p>
          <b>In the summer of 2019</b>, as some teammates bid farewell due to graduation, I took on the responsibility
          of expanding our team. Just like the previous year, we organized this year's campus competition, but this
          time, I had transitioned from being a competitor to a referee. To our delight, the prestige of being world
          champions attracted a remarkable number of passionate applicants. With new talent on board, our team was
          revitalized, and we eagerly embraced innovative designs and strategies. The creative synergy among our
          diverse
          minds ignited a burning desire to once again claim the coveted world champion title.

        <p><b>Covid struck</b> while we were gearing up for an upcoming international competition during our winter
          vacation. Hoping for a quick resolution to the pandemic, we relocated everything from the campus lab to our
          homes. Unfortunately, travel restrictions prevented us from going to the US, leading to the cancellation of
          the competition. It was disheartening to see our new teammates miss out on the opportunity to compete for
          the
          world championship. Nevertheless, their passion remained unwavering, and they continued to work on
          developing
          new travels and code libraries in the next 3 years, regardless of their chances to participate in the world
          championship.

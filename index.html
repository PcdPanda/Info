          <h3>Why 'Panda'</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, I'm <b>Chongdan Pan</b> from Shanghai, China. People also know me as <b>Panda</b>, not only because it
            sounds like my Chinese name but also because it symbolizes Chinese culture. Pandas are globally beloved for
            their adorable appearance, serving as a wonderful symbol that bridges the gap between Chinese culture and
            worldwide admiration. The name '<b>Panda</b>' embodies the qualities of peacefulness and harmony that I
            aspire to embrace. Like these adorable creatures, I strive to bring joy and harmony to the lives of
            thosearound me.<br><br>

          <h3>Childhood in Huangpu</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Huangpu District</b>, the place where I spent my first 18 years, holds the essence of Shanghai, both
            geographically and spiritually. Its inclusive and diverse culture cultivated a wide range of interests
            within me. Every cherished memory is etched in my heart, from the exhilaration of rushing out of the
            classroom to play basketball, to the countless hours spent tinkering with robots in the lab. I would also
            stroll along the enchanting Huangpu River, immersing myself in the harmonious fusion of modernity and
            tradition.<br><br>

          <h3>Undying Passions</h3>
          <p>
            Shanghai culture embraces diverse influences, giving me numerous chances to explore my interests. I actively
            participate in <b>robotic competitions such as Robocup and VEX</b>, which have helped cultivate my
            engineering
            skills. I take immense pride in achieving my dream of becoming a world champion in these competitions.
            I also enjoy watching soccer and stand as a steadfast devotee of <b>Real Madrid</b>. Fascinated by the
            miracles that they've made, I hope I can set foot in the legendary Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium to cherish
            their
            unwavering philosophy of relentless perseverance.

          <h3>Journey in Quantitative Finance</h3>
          <p>After graduating from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I joined <b>Probquant Investment</b>, a high frequency
            trading start-up. There, I devoted myself to developing trading and research systems and took immense pride
            in our efforts to enhance market efficiency.
            <br>During my internship at <b>Jump Trading</b>, their relentless scientific approach left a deep impression
            on me. I find the quantitative finance industry fascinating as it not only expands my knowledge but also
            equips me with lifelong beneficial skills. Now, I eagerly look forward to embracing new challenges at the
            <b>D.E. Shaw Group</b>.

          <h3>My Music Taste</h3>
          <p>
            I thoroughly enjoy immersing myself in various genres of music. When I was
            learning to play the piano as a child,
            I found immense joy in the evocative beauty of <b>Chopin's</b> nocturnes and the majestic symphonies
            crafted by <b>Beethoven</b>.
            As I grew up, the electrifying rock anthems of <b>Linkin Park</b> fueled my energy, and <b>Eminem's</b>
            compelling lyrics ignited introspection.
            With a soulful voice, <b>Adele's</b> songs always have the incredible ability to touch my heart and convey
            emotions I never knew existed.
            These artists have become a source of inspiration and solace, enriching my life in their unique way.

              <h3>My Unbreakable Bond with Robots</h3>
              <br>
              <p>I forged an unbreakable bond with robots in elementary school. Since then, I've actively participated
                in various robotic competitions, from local city events to global stages. After years of efforts, my
                long-cherished dream of becoming a world champion in the VEX Robotic competition finally came true, as I
                proudly led the SJTU1 team to the 2019 Robot Skills World Championship.</p>

              <br>
              <p>I'm proud of applying knowledge and skills to benefit the public. In SJTU, I conducted valuable
                research and published papers on remote healthcare, proving especially relevant during the COVID. At
                Umich, I became a finalist in the fintech crypto challenge with a DApp prototype building trust in the
                healthcare industry. Moreover, I actively contributed to enhancing the efficiency of information spread
                on social media.</p>

              <h3>Embrace Travelling
</h3>
              <br>
              <p>I developed a profound passion for road trips after embarking on a 3000-mile drive from Ann Arbor, MI,
                to San Francisco, CA. Along the journey, the towering Rocky Mountains, majestic shorelines, vibrant
                Antelope Canyon, and refreshing Pacific Coast enchanted me, and amidst these marvelous views, troubles
                seemed to fade away. Since then, I can't resist exploring new places and immersing myself in the beauty
                of nature.</p>
